OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project : password strength checker using python 

objective

The objective of a password strength checker is to evaluate the security of a password by analyzing its complexity, length, and uniqueness. It helps users create strong passwords that resist hacking attempts and safeguard sensitive information.

key activities 
     *Analyze Password Strength: Evaluate the password based on criteria such as length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and patterns to determine its robustness.
     *Provide Feedback and Suggestions: Inform users about the password's strength (e.g., weak, moderate, strong) and offer actionable recommendations to improve it.

Technologies used 
     *python : the primary programming languages used for check the password strength
     *Regular Expressions (re module): To analyze patterns in the password, such as checking for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and common sequences.
     *NIST Password Guidelines (Entropy Calculation): Libraries like zxcvbn (Python implementation) or custom logic can calculate password strength based on entropy and complexity.
